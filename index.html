    <h2>Introduction & Learning Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! I am <strong>Dhruv Parsana</strong>, a third-year Computer Science Engineering student at 
      <strong>Pandit Deendayal Energy University</strong>. My academic journey has been a consistent pursuit 
      of learning and innovation. I participated in <strong>Hackout</strong> organized at DA-IICT, which 
      allowed me to apply my technical knowledge to real-world problems and collaborate effectively in a 
      team environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe in the philosophy of continuous improvement — <em>"Always learning, always improving."</em> 
      My approach to learning emphasizes curiosity, problem-solving, and adaptability. I strive to build 
      solutions that are not only efficient but also impactful. I am particularly passionate about 
      <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>, <strong>Machine Learning</strong>, and 
      <strong>Cloud Computing</strong>, as they represent the future of intelligent and scalable technologies. 
      My passion for <strong>Python development</strong> drives me to keep exploring these domains and 
      develop meaningful, data-driven solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond academics, I value collaboration, creativity, and continuous self-growth. I enjoy taking part in 
      coding challenges, workshops, and technical events that broaden my understanding of emerging technologies. 
      In the future, I aspire to contribute to impactful projects in AI and Cloud-based systems that make 
      technology more accessible, efficient, and sustainable for everyone.
